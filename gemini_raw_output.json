    "prompt": "How do firewalls handle requests from unknown IP addresses?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided text, firewalls handle requests from unknown IP addresses by blocking them, unless explicitly permitted by the firewall's configuration.\n\nNetwork firewalls, in particular, control access to network ports at a low level.  They allow administrators to specify which IP addresses or ranges of addresses are permitted to access specific ports.  If a request originates from an IP address not on the allowed list, the firewall will block the request; the port will appear as if it doesn't exist to the requesting machine.\n\nSoftware firewalls operate similarly.  Simple firewalls examine the source and destination IP addresses, along with protocol and port information.  If the source IP address isn't authorized, the connection is blocked.  Application firewalls add another layer, checking the application involved in the connection. However, the fundamental principle remains the same:  unauthorized IP addresses are denied access.\n"

These courses are intended to enhance your existing knowledge and skills.\n\n* **Broadened Global Perspective:** Studying abroad provides a broader, more global perspective, enriching your overall educational experience.\n\n* **Seamless Credit Transfer:**  Detailed credit transfer information is available to ensure that the courses taken abroad fit smoothly into your degree plan at UNC.  However,  a maximum of 2 courses can be transferred for major credit.  The department prioritizes students taking courses not offered at UNC to ensure a breadth of learning.  This includes the restriction of credit transfer for certain specific courses (COMP 283, 210, 211, 301, 311).\n\nIt is important to note that while general computer science transfer credit will be granted, students are responsible for confirming course acceptance with Professor David Stotts *before* enrolling in international courses.\n"
